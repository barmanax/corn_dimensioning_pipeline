# Corn Ear Detection and Measurement

This project detects and measures ears of corn in images. It performs contour detection, color masking, and bounding box visualization to extract key measurements like average and maximum width/height of the corn ears. The images are preprocessed to align and scale properly before analysis.

---

## Features
- Detect and measure key dimensions of corn ears in images.
- Preprocess images to correct orientation and scale.
- Mask specific colors (yellow or red) for targeted corn detection.
- Apply Gaussian blur, dilate, and contour detection for accurate measurement.
- Visualize contours and bounding boxes.
- Export measurements in a JSON file.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package manager)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**  
python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On MacOS/Linux .\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows

3. **Required Python Libraries**  
If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install the following packages manually:
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib

├── Popcorn Images/
│   └── Ears/                  # Folder containing ear images to process
├── detections/                # Folder where processed images with detections are saved
├── image_data.json            # JSON file with measurement results
└── main.py                    # Main script to run the detection


---

## Usage

1. Place your images in the `Popcorn Images/Ears/` folder. Ensure the images are well-lit and have a green background for accurate detection.

2. Run the main script in your terminal: python main.py OR press the play button when you open the file main.py


3. Enter the color of the corn (`yellow` or `red`) when prompted. All images must be the same color.

4. The processed images will be saved in the `detections/` folder. Measurement results will be written to `image_data.json`.

## Output
The output JSON file (`image_data.json`) contains measurement details for each image:
[
    {
        "name": "IMG_9737.jpeg",
        "avg_width": 120.5,
        "max_width": 150,
        "avg_height": 300.2,
        "max_height": 320,
        "max_width_cm": 7.5,
        "max_height_cm": 19.5
    }
]
